# 4Baller Lotto
---
Runcorn Sports Football Club’s 4Baller Lottery raises vital funds to support and develop the activities which the club carry out in the local community. Profits generated from the Lottery are invested into the club, along with donations made to local charities every month. Charites are picked by our Lottery partners at The Halfway House Runcorn.

The jackpot continues to grow as entrants select four numbers from 1 – 24, priced at £1.00 per entry.

Matching all four numbers, will result in a win of the full jackpot amount (split equally if there is more than one winner). Once the jackpot reaches £1,500.00 it will be capped, and any further entries will then start building the next jackpot!

Matching three numbers, wins the entrant £50.00, which will be split equally between the winners or if there are over 5 winners another draw will take place to decide the 5. If more than 3 people match 3 numbers, they will be entered into a prize draw to decide the 3 lucky winners.

The jackpot amount is an estimated amount rolling over each week until 4 numbers are correctly matched.
