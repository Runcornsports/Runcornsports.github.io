---
Runcorn Sports Football Club supports the FA’s Respect campaign and enforces its guidance throughout the club. More information can be found below and on the following PDF link: [Download PDF](http://www.thefa.com/-/media/files/my-football-resources/respect/adultclubguide.ashx)

## Players
We all have a responsibility to promote high standards of behaviour in the game. Players tell the FA they want a referee for every match, yet 7,000 match officials drop out each season because of the abuse and intimidation they receive on and off the pitch. Respect your referee and you may just get one for every match this season.

Play your part and observe The FA’s Respect Code of Conduct for players at all times. On and off the field, I will:
- Adhere to the Laws of The Game 
- Display and promote high standards of behaviour 
- Promote Fair Play 
- Always Respect the match officials decisions 
- Never engage in public criticism of the match officials 
- Never engage in offensive, insulting or abusive language or behaviour 
- Never engage in bullying, intimidation or harassment 
- Speak to my team-mates, the opposition and my coach/manager with Respect 
- Remember we all make mistakes 
- Win or lose with dignity. Shake hands with the opposing team and the referee at the end of every game

## Coaches, Team Managers and Club Officials:
We all have a responsibility to promote high standards of behaviour in the game.

In the FA’s survey of 37,000 grassroots participants, behaviour was the biggest concern in the game. This included the abuse of match officials and the unacceptable behaviour of over competitive parents, spectators and coaches on the sideline.

- Never engage in, or tolerate, offensive, insulting or abusive language or behaviour 

When working with players, I will:
- Place the well-being, safety and enjoyment of each player above everything, including winning 
- Explain exactly what I expect of players and what they can expect from me 
- Ensure all parents/carers of all players under the age of 18 understand these expectations 
- Never engage in or tolerate any form of bullying 
- Develop mutual trust and Respect with every player to build their self-esteem
