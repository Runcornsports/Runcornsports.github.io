The U18s will be competing in the Warrington Junior League Premier Division in the 2020/21 Season. This league will see the team compete against some of the highest ability local sides at grass roots level. This will offer our assembled squad of talented players a high level of challenge and opportunity to achieve.

In our inaugural season, we are dedicated to offering opportunities for players to play football at a high level and offer opportunities that have not been available readily in Runcorn in the past.

Our Coaching team of Joseph Gough and Ben Hodgson are forging their own career in Sports coaching. Both currently work in providing Sports coaching to junior members of the local community and through developing the skills of individuals by coaching through SGI Academy who work with individuals aged 16-19.

The Management Team are excited about creating an exciting future for the club whilst also facilitating and supporting first team development. Both coaches are current First team members and have genuine excitement about the side they have managed to bring together.

The Team currently trains on a Monday Evening 6pm.
