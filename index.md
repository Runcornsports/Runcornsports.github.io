# Welcome

Welcome to the official site of Runcorn Sports FC

Runcorn Sports Football Club is comprised of two teams: our [First Team](/teams/first/) and our [Under 21's](/teams/u21/). We also
have a development route from Beechwood Junior Football Clubs U18’s providing a natural
progression from junior football to adult football.

Our First Team are currently playing in the West Cheshire 3rd Division for the 2020/21 season after a
successful season in the Crewe and District Premier Division last year. The team triumphed in this
Division, based on a points per game ratio (this has not been officially declared due to the COVID-19
epidemic).

Our U21’s Team are currently pursuing success in the North West U21’s Development League West
Division. This is their first season playing together and is also offering young players an opportunity
to pursue a high quality of football from a younger age.

Throughout the website you will find useful information for fixtures, results, teams, players and
sponsors.

Hosted at Runcorn Sports Club, and playing matches at the adjoining St Clements School, we would
appreciate your support for a community club. If you are able to attend our home games, please do!
