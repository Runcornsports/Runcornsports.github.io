Formed in 2019, Runcorn Sports Football Club was initially named Halfway House Football Club, paying tribute to our roots as a local pub team playing from Runcorn Boys Club on Boston Avenue. During the 2018/19 season the club had two teams; Halfway Athletic who played in the Crewe and District Premier Division and Halfway Rangers who competed in the Warrington and District 1st Division. 

Halfway Athletic had great depth and quality in the squad, making it one of the strongest teams in Runcorn, proven throughout pre-season friendlies against other amateur teams in Runcorn and surrounding areas. Halfway Athletic also enjoyed great success in the Crewe and District Premier Division, being title contenders for the league and having several cup runs, however unfortunately the season was cut short due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Nevertheless, on a point to game ratio Halfway Athletic would have been crowned champions of the Crewe and District Premier Division.

Halfway Rangers enjoyed some great battles in the Warrington & District 1st Division facing some strong competition and a high standard of football. Rangers fell afoul of many games being called off before the season was ended prematurely due to the COVID-19 epidemic.

During the summer of 2020, the committee decided to take the club to the next level and offer the highest level of accessible football from grassroots up the football pyramid. A rebrand was required to enter key feeder leagues and develop a youth protocol, ensuring progression and development of local talent. The rebrand saw Halfway Football Club become Runcorn Sports Football Club and comprise of a [First Team](/teams/first) and an [Under 21’s team](/teams/u21). This also enabled an association to be made with [Beechwood JFC](/teams/u18), and an Under 18’s feeder team was welcomed in June 2020 to provide a natural progression from junior to adult football. 

The club further developed this rebrand by changing its home location to allow further investment into the pitch that was not previously achievable. Runcorn Sports Football Club have signed a lease with Runcorn Sports Club and St Clements School enabling the use of a private pitch and facilities, including a newly renovated club house. The club also launched its [4Ball Lottery](/lotto.html) in association with The Halfway House aiming to raise funds for both the club and local community.

The up and coming season will see Runcorn Sports FC First Team play in the West Cheshire Division 3 League, whilst Runcorn Sports FC U21’s will be playing in the North West U21’s Development League West Division.
